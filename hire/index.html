        I truly believe that it's crucial to empower small teams
        improve their skills and the way they work.
        If you feel like your project is not moving fast enough,
        or if you have trouble getting started, I can help you by ...
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Coaching you or your team to create or scale a product.</strong>
          If you are struggling with a particular point in you software
          production, be it work organization or something more
          technical, it can slow down your project. I can help you get over
          some roadblocks and move faster.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Helping you recruit developers or find your CTO.</strong>
          I'll be able to give you an external and very technical
          point of view on any candidate you might want to hire.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Teaching non technical people about development.</strong>
          As a founder or product owner in a startup,
          it's very important to have some technical knowledge
          to work effeciently with developers. To do so, no
          need to become a full time developer: I can help you to
          quickly grasp the main concepts to be able to understand
          what your technical team is doing.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="example-desc">
        I helped a young team of entrepreneurs with no development background
        <a href="/blog/2014/12/16/coaching-startup-birdly-le-camping/">
          get accepted into Numa (previously "Le Camping")
        </a>, and then
        <a href="/blog/2016/03/14/birdly-ycombinator/">get accepted into YCombinator</a>.
        As tech advisor I help
        them make the best decisions and scale the software side of their company.

        thousands of teams accross the world.

        I'm currently leading the engineering team, but I also
        worked on most of Drivy's components
        such as the search algorithm, the mobile API, the fraud detection
        algorithms, the pricing structure, the internal workflow tools,
        the driver/car matching algorithm, the payment infrastructure...

        I gave classes and lead workshops for HEC students wanting
        to create a web startup. As far as I know, it's the first time people
        were writting JavaScript in this business school.
