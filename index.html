<div id="about">
  <h1><span> Hey ~ </span></h1>
  <p>
    My name is Marc G Gauthier and this is my website.
    If you want to know what I am up to right now, please head over to
    <a href="http://twitter.com/marcgg" class="twitter" target="_blank">@marcgg</a>.
    I also write things in my <a href="/blog">blog</a>, you should take a look.
  </p>

  <h2>Professionally</h2>
  <p>
    Since January 2010 I am the Lead Developer at
    <a href="http://tigerlilyapps.com" class="tigerlily" target="_blank">Tigerlily (FR)</a>,
    a parisian startup helping large brands to improve their presence on Facebook and Twitter.
    Before that I worked for
    <a href="http://www.analogmethod.com/home/" class="analog" target="_blank">Analog Method (NYC)</a>,
    an agency focusing delivering very high quality software and
    <a href="http://www.livetechnology.com/" class="live" target="_blank">Live Technology (NY)</a>
    , a startup developing a large scale web application to optimize marketing. 
    I also spent two internships developing intranet web apps at Sagem and Altran.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even before, I studied at the
    <a href="http://www.u-psud.fr/" class="upsud" target="_blank">University of Paris XI</a>
    &amp;
    <a href="http://www.fiu.edu/" class="fiu" target="_blank">Florida International University</a>
    where I got a Masters Degree in Computer Science.
  </p>

  <h2>Technically</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a big Ruby and Ruby on Rails fan. As a matter of fact, my first project with this framework
    was in 2005 and I never stopped using it since then.
    I also write JavaScript (jQuery, CoffeeScript or even NodeJS) and have a good
    front-end background (HTML/CSS integration from psd files and so on).
    ... and of course I write tests (with rspec) &amp; version my code (with git).
  </p>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>
    At Tigerlily I'm working on projects like the
    <a href="http://www.tigerlilyapps.com/conversation" class="tigerlily" target="_blank">Conversation Suite</a>
    or our
    <a href="http://www.tigerlilyapps.com/products" class="tigerlily" target="_blank">insights solution</a>
    that are used by major brands (Orange, Universal, Spotify, Sony, LVMH, Disney, M&M's...).
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm home, I spend time on
    <a href="http://ffocused.com" class="ffocused" target="_blank">ffocused</a>
    , a free service giving users the ability to create their own
    fully customizable photo portfolio based on their Facebook, Flickr or Instagram accounts.
    Sometimes I freelance, my last mission has been creating social media apps to promote a documentary
    on Arte.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also play around with random projects, such as a Twitter bot acting like a social media consultant or
    a website mapping airport codes to user names called
    <a href="http://whatsmyairport.com" target="_blank" class="wma">Whats My Airport</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the years I have started a number of projects to test out an idea or try a new technology.
    In 2007 one got me on TV, and others got me good grades like
    <a href="http://teamshack.net" class="teamshack" target="_blank">TeamShack</a>.
    They are a bit dated now but they've been a lot of fun.
  </p>

  <h2>Open Source</h2>
  <p>
    I love how open source changed the way we see software, and, time permitting, I try to contribute as I can.
    Right now I've released the source of a few small projects on my
    <a href="https://github.com/marcgg/" class="github" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
    (including ffocused), and got a couple of commits in projects such as
    <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" class="rails" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/arsduo/koala" class="github" target="_blank">Koala</a>, the best Facebook gem out there.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like helping out when I get the time, this is why I hang out on
    <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/90691/marcgg" class="stackoverflow" target="_blank">Stackoverflow</a>
    where I rack up "reputation" points.
  </p>

  <h2>Travel &amp; Photography</h2>
  <p>
    I tend to travel,
    <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.org/people/marcgg" class="couchsurfing" target="_blank">couchsurf</a>
    and take pictures. You can see the best ones on
    <a href="http://ffocused.com/marcgg" class="ffocused" target="_blank">my photo portfolio</a>
    but here's a sample:
