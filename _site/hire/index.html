If you feel like your project is not moving fast enough, if you have trouble getting started, if you're not sure what should be your next move regarding engineering, I can help you by ... </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Coaching you or your team to create or scale a product.</strong> If you are struggling with a particular point in you software production, be it work organization or something more technical, it can slow down your project. I can help you get over some roadblocks and move faster. </li> <li> <strong>Audit or help you build your software engineering processes.</strong> Once you've built your MVP, it's important to you keep moving fast, deliver on time and don't introduce bugs. A strong engineering culture and simple yet effective processes can go a long way. </li> <li> <strong>Helping you recruit developers or find your CTO.</strong> I'll be able to give you an external and very technical point of view on any candidate you might want to hire. </li> <li> <strong>Teaching non technical people about development.</strong> As a founder or product owner in a startup, it's very important to have some technical knowledge to work effeciently with developers. To do so, no need to become a full time developer: I can help you to quickly grasp the main concepts to be able to understand what your technical team is doing. </li> </ul> <h2>Some Projects</h2> <h3>Birdly</h3> <img src="/assets/misc/birdly-yc.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /> <p class="example-desc"> I helped a young team of entrepreneurs with no development background <a href="/blog/2014/12/16/coaching-startup-birdly-le-camping/"> get accepted into Numa (previously "Le Camping") </a>, and then <a href="/blog/2016/03/14/birdly-ycombinator/">get accepted into YCombinator</a>. As tech advisor I contributed to technical decisions and figuring out how to handle the software side of their company while undergoing multiple pivots. </p> <h3>Drivy</h3> <img src="/assets/misc/drivy-header.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /> <p class="example-desc"> I'm currently leading the engineering team, but I also worked on most of Drivy's components such as the search algorithm, the mobile API, the fraud detection algorithms, the pricing structure, the internal workflow tools, the driver/car matching algorithm, the payment infrastructure... </p> <h3>HEC</h3> <img src="/assets/misc/hec-header.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /> <p class="example-desc"> I gave classes and lead workshops for HEC students wanting to create a web startup.

It was a success and WiFilles is gaining more and more traction. </p> <h3>HETIC</h3> <img src="/assets/misc/hetic-header.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /> <p class="example-desc"> For the past 3 years I've been giving Ruby on Rails classes to the fourth year students of <a href="http://www.hetic.net/">HETIC</a>, teaching about object oriented programming, test driven development and web development. </p> <h3>MOOCs</h3> <img src="/assets/misc/mooc-example.jpg" style="width: 100%;" /> <p class="example-desc"> I wrote and presented, in collaboration with OpenClassrooms, two MOOCs about Ruby and Git.
