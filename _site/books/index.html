    Here I share my opinion on what I've been reading.
    If you generally enjoy my blog posts,
    you might share my view on most of them, but again,
    this is just what I thought and this
    isn't at all an analysis of these books.

        <p>An in depth look at how to be more efficient and future proof when writting object oriented code. Reading concrete examples that you can actually apply at your day job is refreshing compared to the countless impractical books out there. Here Sandi Metz explains how to write good and maintainable code if you don’t have time, if the system is evolving and so on. Note that this book is focused on Ruby, but I think that it can interest every developer.</p>

        <p>This book, vastly inspired by The Goal, is a novel describing a group of characters discovering the DevOps ideas on theirselves. The first chapters are all about discovering all the horrifying ways in which IT operations can fail. It’s a lot of fun. The rest of the book is spent in interesting explainations on how to fix and improve the situation. Being used to work in somewhat small companies, it made me rethink how I saw the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> movement as I never really really understood before how distant development &amp; operations can be in larger groups.</p>

        <p>The back cover of this books features an absolutely dithyrambic review from <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky</a>, so I knew it would be worth a read… and it didn’t disapoint! It’s really a must read for anyone working in software development. From the title, it seems aimed at managers, but really everybody would benefit from it as it’s more about interactions between people inside a company. Of course, like any books about humans, nothing is to be taken at face value and there are some generalizations I didn’t agree with, but overall the content is well written and insightful.</p>

        <p>This is one of the books I’ve heard referenced countless times by very smart people before I actually got to read it. Expectations were high, but Andrew Hunt and David Thomas delivered. This book dives into everything that a modern developer needs to aprehend in order to create good software and stay up to date. From ‘crash early’ to its general pragmatic approach, I find myself quoting from this book all the time. It really is a reference for any modern programmers and a must read.</p>

        <p>This must be one of the worse title for a book I’ve ever seen. Actually, only based on this terrible title, I avoided this book and considered it to be a cheesy self help book at best, a pile of ideas to manipulate people at worse.</p>

<p>However, after so many people recommended it to me I ended reading it… and I have to say that it was enlightening. It’s true that a lot of the ideas presented are mostly comon sense focused on a strong sense of empathy, but they are presented so clearly that the author makes you really think about the different interactions you can have during a day.</p>

Overall, even if you don’t want to be writting Elixir most of your time, this book is a great way to understand functionnal programming concepts as well as distributed systems.</p>

        <p>This is one of the books I read when I was still somewhat early in my career, and that had a large influence on how I see work and the importance of work / life balance. This book goes hand in hand with the blog <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/">Signal vs Noise</a> and is full of insightful ideas about how people should create products and companies, such as “meetings are toxic”, “pick a fight”, “planning is guessing”, “<a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/902-fire-the-workaholics">fire the workaholics</a>” and so on. Nothing is new, but the book itself takes every idea and push them further. The result is not perfect, but I really enjoyed it. Good points are made and I often find myself quoting it.</p>

        <p>This book gets into what it means to be a professionnal programmer. It dives into everything ranging from ethics, to commitment to craftsmanship. It contains a lot of real and fictionnal examples and is a great read for any experienced developer. However I have the feeling that  junior developers would not gain as much from reading it since it goes pretty deep situations you might not encounter in your few first years writing software.</p>

        <p>This one is actually a novel about management, focused on a manufacturing plant in the 1980s. The style is not great, the hero is a bit antipatic to me, but the lessons learned through the book are very interesting. The story format works very well to explain the complex ideas behind the author’s  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints">Theory Of Constraints</a>. It’s also surprising to see how some concepts can very much apply to software engineering and operations.</p>

        <p>While I learned Ruby with <a href="http://poignant.guide/">_why’s book</a>, I’ve actually learned <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> reading the first edition of this book back in 2005. Since then I’ve read some of the following editions, and they’ve always been a great way to get a good idea of how to build a web application. I’d say that it’s a great option for any newcomer to Rails that enjoy books rather than online tutorials.</p>

        <p>This book is what drove a lot of people to <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, myself included. It’s weird, humoristic, filled with drawings and absurd comics… but it’s also very insightful and gives great examples of why Ruby is an interesting language. The only certainty everybody have about this is that are no other programming books like this, and I enjoyed it a lot. Nowadays the examples and references are very dated, but the book is available as a <a href="http://www.rubyinside.com/media/poignant-guide.pdf">free PDF</a>, so if you’re interested you should browser through it!</p>

        <p>This books doesn’t bring something radically new to the table, but it succeeds in giving a good state of the art. Here the author presents a wide variety of facts and myths (most well known, but not all of them),  and tries to analyse them. All facts are layed out in the same way and this simple format makes the book really easy and fun to read as you can skip from fact to fact.</p>

        <p>I don’t read a lot of marketing books, but I enjoyed this one. In it, <a href="https://twitter.com/ThisIsSethsBlog">Seth Godin</a> explains how storytelling and the general experience are crucial to sell a product. The book, through a huge number of detailed examples, makes you think about why you’re buying a brand instead of another. I didn’t have any eye opening moment reading, but it was a very well presented piece on the subject.</p>

        <p>This book from 1987 talking about software could feel old and outdated, but it’s really not the case: a lot of ideas and concepts hold true even today. This book focuses on the human side of software development, and this quote sums the situation up perfectly: “The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature”. Overall I didn’t learn something amazingly new reading this book, but it was a very interesting perspective with some ideas worth reading again.</p>

        <p>This interesting book takes an “action oriented” approach to machine learning. It gives a lot of examples and gets you writing code quickly with <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html">R</a>. It also doesn’t get too mathematical on the reader. Overall I enjoyed it as a good introduction to machine learning, but it’s probably a bit too simplified for any hardcore data scientist.</p>

The author explains <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html">the four rules of simple design</a> enounced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent Beck</a> a while back. To do so the author uses his experience in code retreats where he saw a lot of examples surrounding various implementations of Conway’s Game of Life. Overall it’s a well written piece that drives the point home.</p>

        <p>This one is pretty hard to review: it’s design patterns… but in Ruby… and that’s pretty much it! Besides the lack of excitement of the subject, the book does the job well of referencing the mostly used patterns, with precise details and schemas. The explainations are not perfect, but again, it’s a good reference book.</p>

        <p>This book explains all the main concepts behind agile and try to stay out of the hype. It’s refreshing to see a book not treating agile like the perfect solution to everything, and it’s a good reference to check for terms and ideas. However,  I didn’t really learn anything new. I still think that it’s a good starter book for someone not familiar with agile, or a nice way to refresh one’s memory.</p>

        <p>This book, subtitled “A Primer for Programmers Who Lead Programmers”, was actually the first book I read related to my profession that wasn’t technical. It was a few years back and I didn’t lead programmers at this point, but it was very instructive and gave me a new view on what my boss was doing. There are a lot of over simplifications and stereotypes, but the book still gives interesting pointers that - of course - need to be analysed and not blindly applied.</p>

        <p>After hearing a lot about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication">nonviolent communication</a>, I decided to give this reference book a read. It has some interesting points and focuses a lot on empathy which is always a good thing in my opinion. There are a lot of precise examples from the author’s experience and everything is generally well written. However the directions given on how to talk to other people seem very contrived and I can’t see myself realistically using this mode of communication. Overall, while I liked and agreed with the general ideas mentioned in the book, I’m still not convinced by the whole approach.</p>

        <p>This book offers an interesting perspective on the way we operate, and challenges the way we view competition, essentially saying that it mostly leads to issues. The alternative offered is, of course, collaboration. This seems interesting, but the author basically repeat this point over and over and over again with different examples. These examples are very well documented and detailed, but it they get too long and tedious. It seems the same point could have been with a 10 pages articles than with this long book. Overall a lot of potential, but the way it was executed made it very hard to enjoy.</p>

I really enjoyed it so I decided to buy it and give it a read… and I was completely disapointed. Some people might enjoy it, but personnally I only saw one concept: “all ideas are derivative”. This is great for a talk, but after a few hundred pages of just repeating the same basic idea with different examples I grew tired and gave up.</p>
