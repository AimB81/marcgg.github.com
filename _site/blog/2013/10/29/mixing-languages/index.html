<div class="post">
  <p>I was born in France and lived there for the most part of my life. I have the <a href='http://bit.ly/17UlpMx'>frenchiest of names</a>. I&#8217;m not big into striped shirts, but I could easily switch to a cheese-only diet if given the opportunity.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also fair to say that I love the French language. I think that using it well enough can produce <a href='http://www.amazon.fr/L%C3%A9tranger-Albert-Camus/dp/2070360024'>amazing novels</a>, <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rslShTbqNbo'>songs</a> or just cool sounding conversations.</p>

<p>A few years back I went to live in the US. At that point I knew some English from school, but never actually used it in real life. Also, my accent was terrible. After a while I got better at it even if I never got the accent quite down. However to my amusement I could pass for American with French tourists asking for directions in Times Square.</p>

<p>So really I think that the English language is very interesting as well. I wouldn&#8217;t say that I love it as much as I love French, but it&#8217;s a close second. We can say that it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m annoyed about the fact that I can&#8217;t be perfectly billingual.</p>

<p>For the record, I got back to Paris in 2009 so I&#8217;ve lost a lot, so please bear with my written English on this one. I&#8217;m sure talking about mixing languages while writing poorly constructed sentences will sound silly at some point, but hey.</p>

<h2 id='mixing'>Mixing</h2>

<p>The thing is during my time abroad, I started to mix the two languages in my head. In some cases a word in French would come up, sometimes in English, and then, depending on the situation, I would translate it approprietly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been told that you know you can speak a language when you dream in that language. To be honest, while I can sometimes remember the subject of my dreams, I never know what language is being spoken. Same goes for articles that I read online, I&#8217;ll remember the facts but often forget if I read them in French or not. Of course right after I&#8217;ll still have some memory of it, but a few months later some information would stick but the language behind it gets blurry if there wasn&#8217;t some memorable quote in the text.</p>

<p>While staying in New York I met people that would speak English but also some French. This was really a lot of fun since we could just switch back and forth between languages as we felt, picking the most fitting words to communicate. The novelty of doing that wearing off, I realized that it was really the perfect way to go for me. In each languages there are concepts that you can&#8217;t express in the other&#8230; or at least not a specifically.</p>

<p>For instance let&#8217;s take &#8220;whimsical&#8221;. <a href='http://www.wordreference.com/enfr/whimsical'>WordReference</a> would say &#8220;Fantasque&#8221;, &#8220;Capricieux&#8221; or &#8220;Saugrenu&#8221;. To me it doesn&#8217;t work, this is not what &#8220;whimsical&#8221; is at all. There is just no way to capture the essence of this word in French.</p>

<h2 id='translating'>Translating</h2>

<p>Here is a conversation I see myself having all the time:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>« Hey! How do you translate X in French/English ?</p>

<p>- You don&#8217;t !»</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And I&#8217;m not just being annoying. This is quite true that you wouldn&#8217;t say some things this way. Languages tend to lead you in a direction when it comes to constructing sentences and sometimes even your reflection changes when thinking with a given language. If you write something in X and translate to Y, you lose the soul of the text.</p>

<p>Obviously you can do some clever translating, but without moving huge blocks of ideas around, it won&#8217;t sound good.</p>

<h2 id='back_in_france'>Back In France</h2>

<p>When I got back to France I kept this habit going with some friends of mine that could follow such a way of speaking.</p>

<p>The problem was with the others. When unable to use English to complement my French, I would end up stumbling on words, losing track of what I wanted to do&#8230; and overall feeling like I couldn&#8217;t even speak French! Sometimes it could get annoying because France loves to make fun of people mixing languages. The perception of such a person is either that the guy is really smug or just an idiot.</p>

<p>As time passed, my English got worse since I didn&#8217;t get any practice, but I still had this mixing issue. This felt weird because I didn&#8217;t get to speak English everyday anymore, but if you look at my situation it makes sense. My job as a developer requires reading a lot of documentation always written in English with terms that don&#8217;t even exist in French. Once this is done I get to write code, bug reports, emails&#8230; all that in English.</p>

<p>While I like listening to <a href='http://www.europe1.fr/MediaCenter/Emissions/Au-coeur-de-l-histoire/'>podcasts</a> in <a href='http://www.franceculture.fr/emission-les-nouveaux-chemins-de-la-connaissance'>French</a>, I mostly find <a href='http://www.radiolab.org/'>my</a> <a href='http://www.thisamericanlife.org/'>content</a> <a href='http://continuecast.podomatic.com/'>in</a> <a href='http://themoth.org/about/programs/the-moth-podcast'>English</a>. Same goes for reading, I like novels written in French, but most of the blog posts or in-depth articles that I read will be in English. Same logic goes for movies, shows, songs&#8230;</p>

<p>All this seems to keep the confusion alive, even if I don&#8217;t speak the language.</p>

<h2 id='who_cares'>Who Cares</h2>

<p>In the end this isn&#8217;t a real problem for me. I&#8217;d much rather be understood by more people than be perfectly eloquent for less people.</p>

<p>It has downsides, but it often consists in me having to repeat words again in some situations. I manage to mostly use French words and only add English when there is no good translation available. If the person I&#8217;m talking to is not confortable with this I can shift to speaking only French - I&#8217;ll just take a couple more seconds to translate in some cases.</p>

<p>Maybe sometimes people will think that I&#8217;m an idiot, or that I&#8217;m smug&#8230; but I don&#8217;t mind.</p>

<p>I grew to like the process of finding the best way to say something from two sets of words instead of one. It allows me to expand the way I can express a concept, convey an idea or construct a sentence.</p>

<p>&#8230; and if they get to do it in <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crXVMTHZI1Q'>Quebec</a> I don&#8217;t see why I couldn&#8217;t either!</p>
