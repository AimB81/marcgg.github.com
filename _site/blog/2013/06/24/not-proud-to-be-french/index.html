      <p>A few years back, when I was living in the US, a lot of people asked me if I
were proud of being French. I always found this question very strange and
never knew exactly how to respond without getting into a two hours long
argumentation… because no, I am not proud to be French.
Of course to be fair I have to mention at that point that if I were born
American I wouldn’t be proud of it either.</p>

<p>So here’s my humble written reflexion that I will redirect people to next
time I’m asked how I feel about my nationality.
Note that I won’t get into the negative aspects of national pride because I think
it’s beside the point. I can get how people are proud of their countries
without being radical nationalists.</p>

<p>Alright.</p>

<p>To me being proud of one’s nationality makes very little sense. I’m
usually proud of the things I accomplish or, at the very least, that I helped create. If I
work months on a project that succeeds, obviously I’ll be very proud. If I spend
time helping out a friend and she turns out very successfull, I’ll share
a subset of the pride while being happy for her. Being proud
of where I was born sounds a bit like being proud to be blond, or being
proud to be right handed. It’s a fact about me, true, but it does not
define me and I had no choice in it.</p>

<p>I can honestly say that I love France and that being French is a good
situation to be in. I’m not necessarily a big fan of
<a href="http://www.hadopi.fr/">every aspect of it</a>,
but it’s a great place to live. I don’t have to pay
ridiculous tuitions for my education, I get a fair share of freedom,
Paris is one of my favorite cities, I can go in most places in Europe
without having to worry about visas and being able to
speak french will make me seem sophisticated and charming abroad.</p>

<p>It’s pretty cool if you ask me!</p>

<p>The thing is that, while I can feel glad to be born french, I won’t take any
pride in the mere act of being born that is really a product of pure luck.</p>

<p>If my country achieved a lot 300 years ago, what does it has to do with
me and why should all of this influence the way I feel? If I start
to think this way, then comes the question of what
events I should take into account to make up my mind about the way
I “live” my nationality.
It’s a hard question because France did great things and was host
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltaire">amazing</a>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/L%C3%A9tranger-Collection-Folio-French-Edition/dp/2070360024">minds</a>,
but also had some dark sides, both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichy_France">relatively recently</a>
or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_Terror">way back</a>. I’m sure
it’s a harder one for countries with a harsher history.</p>

<p>Of course I’m not asking for a clean slate or to forget what happened in
the past as it’s obvious that we be able to look back at
what occurred before and learn from it. I just think that such a gut
feeling as pride (or shame) has no place here.</p>

<p>There are situations where I could be proud of be a part of my country,
but that would be more the pride of of belonging to a movement I judge
positive or important than something related to my nationality.
To illustrate, if I lived in Canada and the country as a whole, myself included,
did something great, I would have the exact same feeling even though I’m not Canadian.</p>

<p>To conclude I’ll leave you with a song by Brassens, another one of my
most talented fellow countryman.</p>
