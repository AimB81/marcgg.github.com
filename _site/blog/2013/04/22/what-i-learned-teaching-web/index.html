  <span>What I Learned While Teaching</span>

<div class="post">
  
<p>A few months back I wrote <a href="/blog/2013/02/04/developers-teach-non-tech-startup/">an article about how developers should share
their knowledge with others</a>.
Once it was published I received tons of very positive feedbacks from
both developers and non tech people, some of them even asking what
they should do to learn more about how the web works.</p>

<p>At the same time I happened to be talking with a <a href="http://emiland.me/">friend of mine</a>
who started giving classes to young entrepreneurs via <a href="http://leeaarn.com/">leeaarn</a>
and it seemed pretty cool.
One thing lead to another and I decided it would be a good experiment to take this
blog post even further and actually try to create a series of classes to
teach something to non developers.</p>

<h2 id="the-class">The Class</h2>

<p>After discuting with <a href="https://twitter.com/antoamiel">one of leeaarn’s co-founders</a>
we decided on a format of 3 classes of 2 hours each dedicated to
people with little to no experience in creating websites.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Class #1: What is the web (internet, client/servers, networks, IP, DNS…)</li>
  <li>Class #2: What is coding (Front/Back, HTML/CSS/JS, algorithms…)</li>
  <li>CLass #3: How to work with developers</li>
</ul>

<p>I spent quite a while laying out the content of these classes.</p>

<p>Of course I already knew
the subjects quite well but making complex ideas simple can get pretty hard!
Also I had to find a good middle point in technical accuracy and not
boring everyone to death with details or wasting too much time.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-learned">What I Learned</h2>

<p>While I already helped out friends or teammates learning new concepts,
this was the first time where I’d give a more formal class to complete strangers.
In the process I learned a lot.</p>

<h3 id="people-are-interested">People are interested</h3>

<p>I was really surprised when around 10 people showed up,
and even more surprised by how involved they were. A lot of
relevant questions were asked and there often was a discussion going on.
It was great to see a non tech crowd so genuinely interested in concepts
as obscure to them as DNS or source control. This made my day every time.</p>

<h3 id="some-obvious-things-are-not--vice-versa">Some obvious things are not (&amp; vice versa)</h3>

<p>While writing my slides for the first class I overlooked some concepts
that seemed obvious to me and focused on others that felt more complex.</p>

<p>In some cases I was way off, like when I thought that the word “protocol” was known by everyone.
Spoiler: it’s not. On the other hand people understood very quickly what
HTML, CSS and Javascript were and how they intereacted with one another
when I thought it would take half the class to get this point accross.</p>

<h3 id="people-dont-know-much-about-security">People don’t know much about security</h3>

<p>I feel there is a great need of education regarding this
topic. For instance it didn’t shock a lot of people that some websites
would store their password without encryption and send them back by
email when pressing “I forgot my password”.</p>

<p>I hope I freaked them out enough about the risks they’ll spend the extra
time needed to properly secure their company’s website :evilsmileyface:</p>

<h3 id="examples-are-great">Examples are great</h3>

<p>I did some live coding and it seemed like it helped them a lot to understand what
programming is all about. Overall I’d say that 2 minutes spent in the Chrome
inspector are worth 10 slides of tedious HTML syntax description or
any other kind of theory.</p>

<p>I also spent time in the console, using whois, dig, ping, curl and so on to
showcase a bit of the web’s behind the scene. While I think that the
console felt a bit weird to people present (the “wtf is that black screen
with lines of text scrolling?” effect), it helped demonstrate that there is a lot
going on when you try to access a website.</p>

<p>It was also very fun to crash one of the student’s website with a simple
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DoS attack</a>
to explain what this was all about and introduce a part of the class about performances!</p>

<h3 id="two-hours-is-short">Two hours is short</h3>

<p>At first I was really worried I wouldn’t have enough material to keep
people interested for two hours… but by the last session it seemed
like we should have spent a full day talking and there would still be
discussions to be had! The subjects I presented are very broad and each have immense
ramifications, so staying focused and not taking too much time was
actually the hard part.</p>

<p>To sum it up, I now think that it isn’t an overstatement when I say “I
could talk about the web for days”.</p>

<h3 id="public-speaking-is-a-skill-that-requires-practice">Public speaking is a skill that requires practice</h3>

<p>While working on my engineering degree we had quite a lot of projects and keynotes.
This taught us to talk in public, and at the end I felt that I got decent at
it… but damn does it go away! This is clearly something you need
to work on every once in a while to be efficient right away.</p>

<p>In my case it came back very quickly, but the first minutes of the class
were painful and a better preparation would have fixed that.</p>

<h3 id="making-complex-things-simple-is-hard">Making complex things simple is hard</h3>

<p>Ok, this isn’t news to anyone who tried to explain how to use a computer to
an old relative, but it’s always worth mentionning that it really is a challenge.
While preparing for the class I realized that I wasn’t really able to explain some
concepts off the top of my head. Just like public speaking it’s a skill that needs practice.</p>

<p>No wonder the <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive">Explain Like I’m 5 subreddit</a>
is so popular, it truly is an intellectual and stylistic exercice!</p>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>This was a great experience. I got to teach things I am pasionated about and so far
I got some very positive feedbacks. I think that I’ll do it again sometimes!</p>

<p>In the meantime, here’s a picture of me looking all teachery:</p>
