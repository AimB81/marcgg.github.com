      <p>Okay. Let’s start by saying that I’m a developer that does mostly web stuff.</p>

<p>This means that a majority of the code I write will end up displaying something in a browser.<br />
Of course I do <a href="/2012/09/24/working-with-apis-facebook/">interact with APIs</a>, write background jobs, add some<br />
security, optimize databases and so on… the point here is that, professionnally, I do not write<br />
entire projects that have nothing to do with a web app.</p>

<p>My friend <a href="http://www.andreberlemont.com/portfolio/">André</a> on the other hand<br />
has a different background as he mainly <a href="http://www.oneliferemains.com/">develops games</a>.<br />
One evening we started talking about how complex it would be to create an online multiplayer<br />
game from scratch. Being the web guy, I felt that I should know how all this was supposed to work… after<br />
all, the multiplayer happens over the internet, right?</p>

<h2 id="i-can-code-that-with-my-eyes-closed">I Can Code That With My Eyes Closed…?</h2>

<p>On paper it seemed pretty simple.</p>

<p>People connect to a server.<br />
This server keeps the game board and broadcasts it to everyone when<br />
needed. Each player keeps some kind of state on its side for caching.<br />
Everything related to drawing the game board as well as UI should be<br />
handled by the client.</p>

<p>Of course I knew it couldn’t be that simple and I was 100% sure<br />
I was disregarding most of the problems that can occur when creating an online game.</p>

<p>I <a href="/2012/01/09/start-working-on-your-side-project/">already blogged</a> about how side projects are the best response to such<br />
situation, therefore at that point I pretty much had to create some kind of game to try it out!</p>

<h2 id="stack">Stack</h2>

<p>Time being a factor, I didn’t want to go all out game development with C++, Unity or<br />
something like that. Instead I kept it in my “safe” zone by using<br />
technologies I had a bit of experience with:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> (for the server)</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Canvas/Tutorial">HTML5 Canvas</a> (to display the game board)</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">Websockets</a> with <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> (to make it fast)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/stackgame.png" alt="logos" style="margin:20px auto; display: block" /></p>

<h2 id="building-the-game">Building The Game</h2>

<p>I wanted a simple game so that I could focus on the online aspect of it.<br />
The rules I came up with are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are n players represented as squares on a board.</li>
  <li>1 player is the target and earns 1 point per 30 movements.</li>
  <li>If another player hits the target, she becomes the target and win 1 point.</li>
</ul>

<p>I also added a simplistic chat system so that players could talk<br />
to one another during the game.</p>

<p>The first version of the multiplayer code was pretty simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When the player connects she gets the latest version of the game board.</li>
  <li>Each time the player moves it sends an event to the server that<br />
updates the world and broadcasts it to everyone connected.</li>
  <li>Client side javascript renders the board in the canvas at each change.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is when I started to see why it wouldn’t be as simple.</p>

<h2 id="oh-wait-problems">Oh Wait. Problems.</h2>

<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>

<p>My first version was hosted on Heroku and lagged like crazy. This is<br />
because right now Heroku doesn’t support Websockets and forces socket.io<br />
to fall back to its polling mode. After some <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Node-Hosting">research</a><br />
I moved to <a href="https://www.dotcloud.com/">DotCloud</a> and got an impressive boost in speed.</p>

<p>I also had to rewrite a lot of code using <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> because it would make<br />
deployment way easier.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/morestackgaming.png" alt="logos" style="margin:20px auto; display: block" /></p>

<p>Now that hosting and basic interactions were a bit more optimized, I started to see<br />
another problem: passing around the whole board was still too costly<br />
network-wise.</p>

<p>At that moment of development the board was just a JSON object containing<br />
all the players, their names, positions, scores and other meta data<br />
regarding the game. It seemed pretty small but it wasn’t, and as the<br />
game would grow the problem would only get worse.</p>

<p>The solution here would be to only broadcast what changed instead of<br />
redrawing everything. This was annoying because it meant that you need to be able<br />
to draw the board from scratch (when you connect) as well as<br />
incrementally (while you play). Twice the logic.</p>

<p>I also noticed a lag for the player’s own actions. This was because it<br />
would always go via the server before updating the board. As a matter of<br />
fact there wasn’t even a board on the client side, just its rendering<br />
on the HTML5 Canvas.</p>

<p>Soooo to fix this the client code should also be able to know the state of the world<br />
and update it locally.</p>

<h3 id="fun-gameplay--complexity">Fun, Gameplay &amp; Complexity</h3>

<p>A game needs to be fun, or else there is no point. And a couple of laggy<br />
squares moving around is clearly not fun. This seems trivial, but when<br />
you spend your time working on web apps, you don’t spend a lot of time thinking about<br />
whether the app is fun or not. Making it efficient, fast and user friendly<br />
is complicated enought!</p>

<p>I added some rules and gameplay elements to make it feel more like<br />
something one would like to play, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feedbacks when you get hit</li>
  <li>Scoreboards during game</li>
  <li>Invicibility frames when you get hit</li>
  <li>Board boundaries</li>
  <li>Changing a player’s name</li>
  <li>Tweaks in the player’s speed &amp; size</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s also good to know that some of the gameplay elements are based on constants.<br />
For instance you always move of X, and your player is Y pixel-wide. When you get hit you<br />
are invicible for Z frames and so on. To tweak it I had to add a debug<br />
mode to change everything while playing to quickly see how it felt.</p>

<p>All these changes made my simple game complex and it became harder to maintain the code,<br />
even only after something like 6 hours of work in.<br />
I had to throw away a lot of code and start again fresh.</p>

<h3 id="concurent-access">Concurent Access</h3>

<p>When you have a lot of players connected and modifying the same board,<br />
you’re bound to run into some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_control">concurent access</a> issues.<br />
For instance let’s say two players touch the target at the same time.<br />
Who gets +1 point?</p>

<p>To fix this I hacked together a basic<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_exclusion">mutex</a> system<br />
to handle the simple problems that kept on happening. This did the trick<br />
after an hour of code, but it wasn’t something I’d put in production!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall I’m pretty happy with the results.<br />
Even with my lack of experience in the subject I still got<br />
something running and gained a better grasp of why game developers<br />
tremble when you mention online multiplayer.</p>

<p>Now I think the next step would be to design a game taking the<br />
constraints discovered into account in order to simplify development. You don’t want a<br />
game where precision and timing is key.<br />
You could instead create a massively online turn-by-turn game and<br />
save yourself major headaches while still producing something fun! It all<br />
depends if you seek a technical challenge or if you just want to create<br />
a cool project.</p>

<p>Also I’ll need to find a graphic designer because my game looked like shit, but<br />
that’s another story.</p>
