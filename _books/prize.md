This book offers an interesting perspective on the way we operate, and challenges the way we view competition, essentially saying that competition mostly lead to issues. The alternative offered is, of course, collaboration. This seems interesting, but the author basically repeat this point over and over again with different examples. These examples are very well documented and detailed, but it seems the same point could have been with a 10 pages articles than with this long book. Overall a lot of potential, but the way it was executed made it very hard to enjoy.
