This book gets into what it means to be a professionnal programmer. It dives into everything ranging from ethics, to commitment to craftsmanship. It contains a lot of real and fictionnal examples and is a great read for any experienced developer. However I have the feeling that  junior developers would not gain as much from reading it since it goes pretty deep situations you might not encounter in your few first years writing software.
