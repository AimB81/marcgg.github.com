When it comes to automating repetitive tasks, there seem to be two schools of thought. Either it's a good thing or it's overkill.

## Schools Of Thought Regarding Automation

The first one is that only fools would spend their time doing these manually and not write a script. In this scenario, the developer "wins" while the poor commoner "loses". Hm.

The second one is that the developer is wasting their time because automating the task is often more complex than it seems, and it would have been simpler and more efficient to just do it manually. These nerds can't just keep their heads down and do simple tasks, they have to overcomplicate everything! Hm.

Personnaly, I think that the following graph by [Jon Udell][1] is closer to a real life and effective way of thinking of the link between automation and time. Of course it's also less funny than the xkcd one but that's fine.

## The Missing Factors

The thing is, we're missing important factors when talking about deciding the value of automation. In these kind of graphs or comparaisons we're mostly wondering if automating will make us gain time, when really time is just one factor in a complex equation.

__Let's take an example__ and say that every day I need to manually write down 10 numbers in a spreadsheet. Doing this will take me 1 minute, and automating it would take approximatively 10 hours.

If we only base our logic on time and I trust my[estimate][2] of 10 hours, it should become interesting to automate after *600 working days*. That's a long time. We should probably not do it, right?

### Energy

When doing a repetitive task, you're not only spending time, but also energy. A task can be short, but it can be exhausting mentally. If every time I write down the numbers I have to be cautious not to make mistakes, it might takes a lot of my concentration and drain energy.

Once the task is done, I might not be able to go back to the exact thing I'd want to be doing and pick something easier just to do something simpler for a bit.

### Frustration

In the meantime you're also building frustration. In the long run this can be a problem.

However, I also need to think about doing it, do it on time and do it right. Once I've done it a few dozens of times, it starts getting annoying. After hundreds of times, it seems like a complete waste of time and I might even get mad at the very idea of having to do that.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/frustration-productivity-automation.png" style="padding: 20px; width: 420px;" alt="Relation between automating tasks and frustration" /><em>Note how the time spent each day increases once the productivy starts to decrease.
</em></div>

Adding too many repetitive tasks that are not worth automating and you could end up with an hire turnover, a toxic atmosphere or some very low productivity number.

### Focus

Every day I would need to do this one task. I also probably have a few others tasks just like this. To be able to complete them on time, I might have to stop what I'm doing at some point and shift my focus to this repetitive task. Even if the task itself takes 1 minute, the context switching will cost way more. 

### Growth

Getting very good and as fast as possible at a daily repetitive task happens rather quickly. Once the task is mastered, all that remains is doing it over and over again.

In this situation, automating can become a great opportunity to learn something new and think outside the box. This is especially true for non programmers: they can take the opportunity to improve their Excel skills or get into a simple programming language in order to write small scripts.

## When To Automate

As we saw, these three factors all have an impact on productivity and long term. Focus and energy have a short term effect, when frustration starts to show on a more medium to long term scale.

Overall it is very hard to know what's the optimal time to automate. Do it too soon, you might waste time, do it too late and you'll get the same problem. However, I feel like it's more efficient when you don't only take time into account when deciding what action to take.
