This is one of the books I've heard referenced countless times by very smart people before I actually got to read it. Expectations were high, but Andrew Hunt and David Thomas delivered. This book dives into everything that a modern developer needs to aprehend in order to create good software and stay up to date. It delivers important lessons and I now find myself quoting it constantly when [coaching teams][1] or [teaching junior developers][2].

The book is filled with situations that every professional developers encounter in their lives: estimations requests, "programming by coincidence", how to do design by contract or what tools to use. It also describes some best practices such as "[crash early][3]" or ways to minimize [coupling][4].

This book is one of my references, and I can't recommend it enough. If you haven't read it yet, you should!
