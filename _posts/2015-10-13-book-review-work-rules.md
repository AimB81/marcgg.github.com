This book is a must have for anyone interested in recruitment, human ressources or Google's approach to problems in general. In it [Laszlo Bock][1], the  Senior VP of People Operation for Google, goes in depth to explain the inner workings of how his company deals with anything related to people.

I personally enjoyed the overall experience of reading this book. However, some chapters were way better than others. For instance, the one about recruiting was one of the most insightful piece on the subject I read since [Joel Spolsky][2]'s [Guerilla Guide to Interviewing][3]. It was surprisingly open on the findings of Google as well as the mistakes they made.

Chapters about Google's approach to data in HR were very interesting as well, even if they were not as actionnable for my situation since I'm part of a smaller company. It's great to get an insider's view of how a successful company iterates on their processes while learning from their mistakes.

Some other parts of the book were hit and miss for me, like the ones on how to pay people or how to nudge them in the right direction. They seemed either completely obvious or too vague to be of any real use.

Overall this book delivered on its promise. It was full of insights and it is entirely possible to act on some of them to change the way you work. Personally I changed a bit my approach to interviewing and integrated some questions mentioned in the book. Laszlo Bock is very honest and, even if there is a bit too much "Google propaganda" sprinkled on top of things, it never seems like there are crucial omissions as he admits when the company made errors.

If you're into human resources stuff, I'd say read it!
