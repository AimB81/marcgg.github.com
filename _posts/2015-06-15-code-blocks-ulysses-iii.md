title: The Best Text Editor For Tech Bloggers
description: I've been looking for the perfect editor to write blog articles and short stories. It's been especially hard since I have some weird needs due to the fact that I include code snippets in my articles... but I finally found Ulysses III and after a year using it I can safely say that it's amazing.

I've been on a never-ending quest for the perfect tool to write blog posts and short stories. I've tried everything from Word to Vim, from Pages to Google Doc, from Byword to iA Writter.

Finally, last year I found [Ulysses III][1], and I've been hooked since then. It is a great app and I would go as far as to say that it is probably the best piece of software out there for writers.

It might not fit everyone since it uses Markdown... however, if you're a developer with a blog, I'm fairly confident you'll love it. I won't get into all the features - because there are a lot. Instead I'll focus on what makes it great for my use when writing tech articles.

## Markdown Done Right

In Ulysses, you get to write markdown. This means you don't need to pause to think about formatting or adding links. It's great. It also means you can feed the file to a blog engine like [Jekyll][2] and it will work right away. Double great.
 
The software comes with some very simple styling. Titles, links and other key elements are displayed differently so you get some sense of how it's going to look and don't get lost in a huge file with no formatting. 

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/ulysses_format.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/></div>

There is also the right amount of help. The app will never get in your face going "it seems that you want to add a link here, do you need help?". However, it will give you the right amount of help so you don't need to stop in your track to type some tedious markdown.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/ulysses_help.jpg" style="width: 300px;"/></div>

## Developer Friendly Customisation

If you're a developer, you're probably used to tweak your text editor's theme to be "just right". Maybe you like [Solarized][3], maybe something else. Well, Ulysses gives you the same level of control as any text editor or IDE. There is even a way to switch between a dark and a light theme!

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/ulysses_themes.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/></div>

## Including Code In Your Articles

If you need to include code snippets in your articles, Ulysses III will also help you out. For instance:

	this_is.some(code) -> "Amazing"

Looks like this:

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/ulysses_code.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/></div>

If you're like me, you might need some more customisation, like some custom HTML or CSS for a given article. Personally I really wanted a way to say "leave me alone" to my editor so I could really do whatever I want. To do this, Ulysses has this syntax:

Leave me _alone_ <br>
<em>I know what I'm doing</em>

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/ulysses_alone.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/></div>


## Smart Pasting

When I'm writing a tech article like the one about [Elixir][4], I usually code in Vim, run the code a bunch of times from the console, and finally paste it into Ulysses.

If you like this workflow, then you'll love Smart Paste. Using ⇧⌘V (shift-command-V) when pasting, you get this nice prompt helping you get the correct formatting right away.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/ulysses_paste.jpg" style="width: 400px;"/></div>

## 3 Columns Layout

Ulysses takes the approach of having a 3 columns layout, and I love it. It makes it very easy to find information and split your long articles in smaller files if needed.

<div class="image-wrapper" style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/blog/ulysses_layout.jpg" style="width: 500px;"/></div>

## So What's The Catch? 

The app is quite expensive.  They do offer a free trial, so you get a chance to test it out before buying, but you'll need to pay if you really want to use it.

I think it's worth it and I was happy to pay for it, but I get that some people would prefer a cheaper alternative.
