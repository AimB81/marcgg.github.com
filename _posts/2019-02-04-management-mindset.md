title: "The Developer / Manager Feedback Loop Difference "
description: "A lot of developers turned engineering managers often feel like they are not being productive, and it seems like they are not accomplishing anything. This is most likely related to the vastly different feedback loop between the two positions."

Most software engineers turned managers I've met struggle with the same issue in their first weeks on the job and usually end up saying something like: "I couldn't get any work done this week!".  Of course everybody expects to have more meetings, move  to a [manager schedule][1], but most are not prepared enough to the major change in feedback loop that occurs.

## The Developer Feedback Loop

Building software can get frustrating, but it's also very rewarding. Before the developer's involvement there was a bug or a feature was missing and once they're done the problem is fixed. On top of this, you get to focus on writing code most of your day then, at the end, you have a few commits to show for it. That's pretty good in my book!

Overall the feedback loop is quick and simple with things such as:
- Your tests go from red to green
- The project compiles
- Your PR gets approved and released
- A given library is succesfully updated
- Performances improve in your app and you have the graphs to prove it
- The number of errors reduces in a given area

Overall it has a lot of cases where either it works or it doesn't. Also your work can easily be showcased to other and you can generally say "look at what I built!".

## The Manager Feedback Loop

As a manager it is quite different. You are not required to build things directly, but instead empower your team to do it as well as possible.

To achieve this, you might spend more time attending meetings or talking to people without any direct visible result. You will also work on very long term plans where you will notice the benefits only after months or years. You're also not the one "actually" building the software, so it's easy to think that you're not _really_ being productive.

It's not that you're suddently useless, it's the fact that the feedback loop is different. It's more subtle and on a longer time frame... and in most cases if you do things right no one might not even notice! Instead of a couple of features in front of happy users each week, you could have to wait a year to see that Alice became more productive thanks to your guidance, or that Bob really grew into his new role as technical lead.

The feedback loop this time is longer and harder to measure:
- A person in your team improves over time
- Technical choices are proven to be right year after years
- People better understand the context they're building software in, objectives are clear
- The team remains productive
- Turnover stays low, people stay happy
- Project are delivered on time
- No one is working crazy hours to reach objectives
- There's not many complaints from your reports
- External & internal clients are consistently happy
- There's a general feeling of moving forward

This isn't a bad thing, it's only a difference to keep in mind. In order to avoid being stressed out or depressed, new managers need to understand this concept as soon as possible so that they can focus on what matters instead dreading this feeling of unproductivity.
